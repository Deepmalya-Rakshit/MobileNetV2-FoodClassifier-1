# MobileNetV2-FoodClassifier

This project utilizes a dataset acquired via web scraping from Unsplash, comprising diverse high-quality food ingredient images.

Employing transfer learning with MobileNet V2 for feature extraction, fine-tuning, and hyperparameter tuning, various models are trained for image classification.

The selected model is converted into TensorFlow Lite format for efficient deployment on mobile and edge devices, ensuring practical application in real-world scenarios.
